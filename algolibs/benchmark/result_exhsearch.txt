Best of 5: 1.4s.

maze graph: replacing vector of vectors by one vector
Best of 5: 1.315s.

maze graph: anonymous namespace instead of static members
Best of 5: 1.293s.

maze graph: out paths with scoped enum and bitfiddling instead of string
Best of 5: 0.918s.

multi-start bfs: reserve number of output-nodes = number of starts
Best of 5: 0.878s.

refactoring graph: made Node publicly accessable
Best of 5: 0.916s.

Straights only two rotations:
Best of 5: 0.463s.
Best of 15: 0.435516s.

Moved some small methods to header, allowing for inlining:
Best of 15: 0.391461s.

tried to improve getLocation, which currently searches over all nodes. Made it search directly on
nodes instead of through getNode(Location).
Best of 15: 0.413454s.
-> Slower, due to computation of Location from index

Ideas:
- more inlining, e.g. operators of neighbor iterator
- more noexcept
