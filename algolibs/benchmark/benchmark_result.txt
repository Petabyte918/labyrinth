All times measured with x64-Release build.
New baseline:
Benchmarking isReachable() for snake graph with extent 7, running 2000 queries, 10 times.
Best run took 11us per query.
Benchmarking isReachable() for snake graph with extent 14, running 2000 queries, 10 times.
Best run took 43us per query.
Benchmarking isReachable() for snake graph with extent 28, running 2000 queries, 10 times.
Best run took 172us per query.


Implementing neighbors as a range (iterator pair) of Locations, 
instead of creating and filling a vector:
Benchmarking isReachable() for snake graph with extent 7, running 2000 queries, 10 times.
Best run took 8us per query.
Benchmarking isReachable() for snake graph with extent 14, running 2000 queries, 10 times.
Best run took 32us per query.
Benchmarking isReachable() for snake graph with extent 28, running 2000 queries, 10 times.
Best run took 125us per query.
Next steps: inlining. refactor. end iterator should not call moveToNextNeighbor. padding around graph to get rid of the bound check.
Scaling is linear -> only measure for extent 28.

Inlining Location::getColumn() and ::getRow()
Benchmarking isReachable() for snake graph with extent 28, running 2000 queries, 10 times.
Best run took 82us per query.
